Long time ago, there is one grandfather living in the backyard in countryside. He is very poor. His son left him alone in the old house and the son stole the money from the grandfather to go in the city. His son named "Michael." Howeever, michael can use the money that is stolen wisely. He use this money to invest and this money go double. He becomes a millionaire in a few year. 

Using his new found fortune, Michael decides to right the wrong he committed against his father. Michael journeys back out of the city to visit his father and share with him his new found success. 
He arrives at his father's house and knocks at the door. Someone unfamiliar answers the door. "Hello, can I help you?"... Michael says "Yes, I am looking for Peter (the name of his father), is he here?"
The woman at the door responds "Oh my goodness, I am sorry, he went into a depression and died after his son took his money and abandoned him."

All of a sudden, great remorse mixed with other complex feelings come altogether into Michael's mind. He has always been a proud man who never believes that fate would turn away from him, he was determined to leave his father as he wanted to prove to him that he himself could shoot for the stars and set a much better life for Peter. All those memories of his childhood that Peter took great care of him and loved him so much surges, his heart trembles. 
With his knees about to fall, a familiar sound coming behind the door.
